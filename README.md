### Summary

Nes emulator written in Harbour compiler.

Perhaps it is the best source for developing other emulators for high-level languages.

Based on beaultiful project

https://github.com/fogleman/nes

### Compiler
To compile use:

compile.bat

### Optimizations

Harbour is a tool for using commercial applications.

For emulation it works slow, however this work can be used so that the build is optimized and improved.

### Todo

- APU
- Controller

I'm sorry, my time is short for the project, I hope someone collaborates.
